1. Efficent string concat
    current algorithm for concat is really bad.
    please cure this sickness

2. Better stack implementation using linked list
    Current implementation just uses an array list (from list.h) but it causes
    a lot of unnecesary copying.

3. memory leaks fix
    there are A LOT OF memory leaks at the moment. use valgrind or some other tool

4. Expect function for checking if enough number of items and correct types are provided for any operation.
